# The Fearless Dev

It's July 2020. 
I have been in tech now for over two decades spanning mobile, web, distributed systems, cloud and AI domains.

I've been a researcher and a developer. 
A founding engineer, and a VP of Engineering at a startup. 
A teaching assistant, and an adjunct faculty.
A conference organizer, and a conference speaker.
A community building, and technology advocate.
I've built a lot of knowledge, but I am nowhere near done.

The roles keep changing, but one thing remains constant.
In everything I do, I always keep learning. 
But I always struggle with impostor syndrome.
I never see myself as an expert because I have come to see experts as always-successful, all-knowing people.

I am not always successful. In fact I fail. A lot. And I learn from it.
I am not all-knowing. In fact I consider myself a lifelong beginner. I constantly pick up new knowledge to solve new problems.

In July 2020 I had an epiphany.

**We all have *a lof ot* knowledge** - it's the vast amount of information we have acquired over a lifetime of experience.

**We all have *some* expertise** - it's typically in the area that you work on most frequently, most recently.

**But we are all afraid of being judged and found lacking** -- because our expertise (what we work on now) is likely to be just a small fraction (like 2% of the Smithsonian on exhibit) of our actual knowledge base (what we learned in our lifetime). But we actually compare ourselves to peers whose journeys, experiences and tenures are vastly different from ours.

And because we are afraid, we don't share our failures or our learning journeys, and in doing so we perpetuate this myth of the rock star coder.
I wanted to change that.

In July 2020, I wrote up a mission statement and decided to learn (and fail) in public.
To be fearless about not just learning, but standing up for the right thing in all my activities.
To rediscover the sheer joy of problem solving, discovery and connecting with people whose principles and journeys intersect with mine.

Hence fearlessly.

My motto is "try-fail-learn".
My mission is "make **complex ideas** and information understandable to **diverse audiences** in ways that drive **actionable learning**

This is my roadtrip sandbox. Welcome.
